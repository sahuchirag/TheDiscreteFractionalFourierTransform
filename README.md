# TheDiscreteFractionalFourierTransform
The Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform (Code in MATLAB)

This is a project based on MATLAB.
It is an implementation of the research paper 'The Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform' by Ã‡agatay Candan, M. Alper Kutay and Haldun M. Ozaktas.
This project tries to provide a definition and determine (by simulation) the 'Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform' of a given signal by a method of eigen-vector decomposition. We try to consolidate a definition of the 'Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform (DFrFT)' that generalizes the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) just along the lines as continuous fractional Fourier transform generalizes the continuous ordinary Fourier transform.
