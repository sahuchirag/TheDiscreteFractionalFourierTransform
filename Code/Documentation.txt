Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform

In the file 'testfrft.m', define the values of 'x'(time axis) along which you wish the signal to be defined. Define the signal as 'y'.
On running the code, the graph will show the real, imaginary and magnitude of the discrete fractional Fourier transform of the signal.
The file 'DisFrFT.m' is the function file of discrete fractional Fourier transform.

The Hermite-Gaussian functions can be implemented with 'Hermite_Gaussian.m' code. 
Enter the value of 'k' for which you wish to determine the Hermite-Gaussian function.
